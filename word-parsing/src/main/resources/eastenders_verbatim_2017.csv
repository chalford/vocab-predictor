I have heard that Lee is going to leave, if it is true, then maybe it could be regarding depression and that would go down well with the public (give out a help line number at the end of the programme). The best characters I like are Honey and Billy. Simple characters who value their children and family life. Maybe more characters should feature like this, rather than a bunch of drunks always in the pub !!",15243149,EastEnders,2,53,4

01/01/2017,"Wow, I didnt see that coming. Had assumed that the catastrophic event referred to either Phil or Dot. If I was Jack I would be questioning why the hotel did not have CCTV in the swimming pool area or, at the very least, the door was not locked. Would have liked to access the Snapchat alternative ending but dont have this facility. My heart went out to Jack on the poignancy of the shot of him asleep on the bed with Amy and Ricky, now he will have three children to bring up on his own. This is all assuming that both Ronnie and Roxy have drowned! Are we about to have 'musical chairs' with residents moving around the square following the drowning? The best way for Lee and the Carters to move forward is for him and Whitney to move back home, and I hope that the Samaritans get a well deserved plug in the coming weeks. It also raises many questions as to the lack of 'follow up' on soldiers once they leave the army.",13900317,EastEnders,2,57,9

Beautifully written, tightly directed and not a hint of the shocking ending. This was definitely worthy of an award and well done to the new director for putting the oomph back into a show that was becoming more and more mundane.

01/01/2017,I liked the acting of ronnie and roxy. It showed the true love of sisters but i didnt like the storyline for their last scene. It was an anti climax for me. I thought i would be emotional because they were two of my favourite characters but my eyes were dry.,914236,EastEnders,2,46,8

01/01/2017,It was a disturbing programme. It was widely rumoured that Ronnie and Roxy were to die and this took away from the shock element that would otherwise have been much stronger.

02/01/2017,This was two of the best episodes for a Year from Eastenders. At last we are showing some good stuff. I think because it was in the Hotel it changed. The Wedding Party the episode before was excellent. (normal) and did not seemed overacted as it usually does. Jack excellent. Glad Max is back and changes. Now it is going well do not make everyone weak as usual. Lets have strong Characters for a change. Eastenders has made everyone weak. Michelle just is not right person for this role. Too posh looks like a policewoman with that haircut. She does not cut it after remembering the old Michelle,10639595,EastEnders,2,70,9

02/01/2017,It will be intriguing to see how the script writers deal with the deaths of Ronnie and Roxy and how each of the other characters respond to the devastating news. I was confused as to why the police did not acknowledge Jack as a previous member of the 'force'. Why did Max not flush the drugs down the sink at the hotel and why did he do so at Jack's house as surely if the police conduct a thorough search this would shift the blame onto Ronnie? Where is Max getting his money from? His watch looks as if it should have cost thousands of pounds. And what is Michelle really doing back in Walford?,13900317,EastEnders,2,57,8

05/01/2017,Jack is still trying to come to terms with the deaths of Ronnie and Roxie and he has still not told the children until Dot told them during a meal for the family. The acting particularly by 'Jack' has been excellent and very believable. Mick appears to have accepted the fact that Babe over the last year or so has cheated and done some very nasty things.

12/01/2017,The new Michelle is irritating and whiny. The dialogue was convoluted and took too long to get to the point. I take it that the story-liners know that the age of consent in Florida is 17 so Michelle's actions would get her some serious jail time?,13215140,EastEnders,1,40,3

12/01/2017,"This episode almost turned into a 'double hander' with Sharon and Michelle, and I found myself willing them to get to the crunch line all through it. There were points when I questioned the continuity though - did Sharon return to her house with Michelle's suitcase or not? because when Michelle walked in through the back door she did not have it with her. It was good to see that despite all that each had put the other through over the years' their childhood friendship overcame everything with Sharon telling Michelle that she would always have a home with her. I feel for Dot who appears to be sinking into dementia rapidly, and I worry for her health with having 'Ethel Esquire' around. It is a pity that Abby is not around enough to see what is happening to her grandmother despite living in the same house.",13900317,EastEnders,2,57,8

12/01/2017,"It was ok. Eastenders has massively improved in the past month or so - after some years of being utter rubbish. I like very much the slower - more natural and realistic - pace, and less frequent over-the-top sensationalist storylines (murders every week, etc type style that the soaps sadly leaned towards in recent times). Yesterday's was slightly dull - unfortunately I can't take to the recast Michelle and didn't think too much of her acting. She might be ok as an actress in a different role (I don't know) but she doesn't seem to manage well as Michelle especially as it seems to me (I have family with East End/cockney roots and accents) that her accent is put-on (naturally middle-class trying to be cockney), which makes the acting harder for her because she is focusing too much on trying to get the accent right. Having said that I think it is in keeping with her character - the bad behaviour (having sex with a 17 year old boy) - because she has always been a bit selfish - what she did to Lofty, sleeping with her best friend's father (and then later, Sharon's ex-husband), etc. I think my main issue really is the notion that Phil Mitchell would be a man any woman would fight over. He really is foul -ugly inside and out, and so it's a shame that Sharon has been lumbered with him. She should dump him and find someone she deserves (someone better).",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

13/01/2017,"I think that this story does not reflect the reality of the Denise situation with her baby. In reality, Denise's wishes would have been carried out at the hospital. Once you state that you do not want the baby as from the moment it is born, then hospital staff take it away immediately. I cannot believe that a woman like Denise would be so intimidated by Shirley to reveal the baby's father. Are the writers going o have this baby adopted, then in 15 years time introduce he character as he appears as the long lost son ? Frankly, I think that it is a shame, but Eastenders is getting more ridiculous to watch. All is forgiving, no matter what you do to one another. Break into the family home, have sex with your fianc̩e, everyone is so dim and stupid. The programme needs to get some seriously good story writers to re create this soap.",15243149,EastEnders,2,53,1

Also don't think ""shagging"" should be mentioned. And what's with all the talk about Michelle's sex life? Firstly, it's not really appropriate and secondly, it was mind-numbingly boring.

It would be good if Whit left Lee, there's no hope for him, he's not very bright, he's clinically depressed, he's incapable of telling the truth and he's a petty criminal. Whit is too good for him. As for the newly restored Phil and his equally unpleasant household, I'm tired of him and them, they will never agree or like each other or offer genuine understanding and love for their fellow man let alone their relatives. Why anybody would want Phil giving a eulogy at the funeral of a loved one is completely implausible. All my sympathy is for Denise and wanting the ghasty judgmental characters to be nicer. Hope she has a wonderfully successful affair with her English tutor - just to see someone happy for a change.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

Upon comeing home for s visit 3 years ago now he did not try to take over the hesting by moving the settings up nor did he critacise our towels and bedding, or try to interfere between me and my husband. Why the script writters would write these things in I dont know ad these things just fo not happen in the real world. Having wstched this souo dince the very firdt show back in 1985 I find myself now getting more and more dissapointed with what are now becoming more than normal unbelievable storylines. Wake up writters and start by makingvtjis show more believable and try letting peolle smile a bit more and giving 'married couples' a chance of happiness and not killing them off as soon as they are married or argueing and close to spliting up with in months of marrying.

Kim not understanding why Denise may not have what it takes to raise another child -resukting from a drunken one night stand with Phil, after all she has been through is also confusing.

24/01/2017,For a major desaster surely the Firemen ambulance would have been there quicker.? I saw one paramedic? this was rediculous. As for the lifting of the Bus would they have been able to do this? The Bus i thought was stuck under the Bridge? Anyway it was good acting but i was not convinced. As usual a disaster to boost the ratings. So many disasters in one place? Is this to be believed. Too much of a coincidence with the train journey of Shirley etc. But however Shirley and her sad dementia mother were BRILLIANT ON THAT TRAIN. THIS WAS REALLY FUNNY AND THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF IT.,10639595,EastEnders,2,70,8

24/01/2017,This episode was a bit like Hollyoaks in that the show had become stagnant so the writers decided to have a major incident involving many characters. I remain perplexed as to how so many people lifed a bus but nobody saw Whitney/ her phone. I also do not understand why nobody noticed the boy with the phone going around filming the incident with a smile on his face and didn't give him a slap. I understand many people have become intellectually-vacant and sadistic but is this not going a bit far?,15454160,EastEnders,2,33,8

24/01/2017,"thought the accident was badly written and very far fetched, they can't get the tonnage right on the bus, and how come a bus went down the market square, they never go down that route, and amazing how Kathy can stop a tube as well, all very badly written, Denise could have got out and everyone just left the poor driver having a heart attack. That wouldn't be done and what about the little boy whose missing everyone forgotten about his it's not realistic as the for the paramedic wouldn't want her treating me, you'd never move someone from under a bus unless it's about go go up in flames, none of the kids were hurt they were all at the back of the bus who writes these dreadful story lines need to be sacked",2580338,EastEnders,2,70,2

26/01/2017,"I watched all this week's episodes yesterday to catch up on the bus crash drama. It was a good storyline but it felt too soon after the Ronnie & Roxy deaths for such high emotion and drama. I'm pleased they didn't kill anyone else off as it would've felt ridiculous especially as I wasn't impressed with how Ronnie and Roxy were written out. Eastenders feels like it's going for major awards recognition at the minute with all the dramatic storylines and creative way it's trying to film certain scenes, but just sometimes happy endings for characters can be captured beautifully as well without the need for all the gruesome bits. One thing I wish to plea is for there to be nothing developing between Whitney and Mick. Fine if she has a crush on him because her husband is not being the man she wants him to be but not on Mick's side. His and Linda's relationship has always been pioneered on the show as being solid. They're together no matter what difficulties they face. So if he has an affair it makes a mockery of that entire set up. Please Eastenders producers and writers don't do it! We need one happy couple with a relationship that stands the test of time and stays solid!",1472653,EastEnders,2,37,9

Boring and why is Michelle been brought in? She is too posh in her accent to be an eastender you can just tell. She isnt very good either. Looks nothing like Michelle.

02/02/2017,This was a bizarre episode. Kim's outburst at Denise's college was completely out of proportion to the situation and only reinforced the stereotype of 'angry black women'. The storyline involving the teenagers spreading videos and photos via their phones is not being played out as well as it could be. Louise appeared to get the number of the boy she liked from the drama club but found that another boy was sending her messages. The boy from drama club seemed oblivious to this. Why? Louise sent the naked photo of Shakil of from Rebecca's phone which is against the law. Jay dated a girl 6-7 years younger than him without knowing after she lied to him about her age and ended up on the Sex Offenders Register for 5 years.,15454160,EastEnders,2,34,7

Yesterday's episode wasn't great but it was okay. The Denise reveal at the end (her mother saying she wasn't really her mother) just as she got into the cab to go home was quite amusing/funny (in that kind of soap way - i.e. major reveal just as I disappear!).",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

06/02/2017,The continuing disruption in the Fox family was only interesting for the final few moments when the drunken non-mother revealed that Denise is not her daughter. Lucky Denise.

And then we hear that Lynda and her mother are now in Watford. Last I knew they were still in Spain? Plus Watford isn't so far away that she couldn't go home and just visit her mum every other day. Ridiculous. But at least Babe finally got her come-uppence, although it took long enough. And what's with all the gypsy ""I curse you"" stuff at the end?!",16723129,EastEnders,2,25,4

09/02/2017,I think yesterday's first episode ended brilliantly. Aunt Babe cursing the Carters was great - really well done. It was slightly hammy/panto/camp but it worked - it was a fitting way for her character to leave. The actress did a great job at portraying a panto villain - Aunt Babe was a great villain. I'm finding Eastenders watchable again after years of being rather rubbish. I watched from the start but then stopped watching regularly about 10 years ago. I'm now watching regularly again (the past few months).,14982633,EastEnders,2,41,8

10/02/2017,"I watch this soap to keep an elderly relative company. It mostly bores me and frequently its gloom and general unpleasantness annoys me. So few of the characters have any redeeming features, they are either stupid, avaricious, on the edges of criminality. Practically all the 'families' are disfunctional. There are characters so horrible I find their presence upsetting. I think the Carter family has now replaced the Mitchells as my least favourite, I'm sick of the lot of them. Sick of their fecklessness, their spinelessness, their general lack of intelligence (Johnny excepted) It's not possible to care about them. The latest drama stemming from the selling of alcohol out of hours is dull as it is nasty. Michelle Fowler is surplus to requirements and I hope she will soon disappear, but her kindness to Bex was rather touching. Otherwise, last night's episode barely held my interest.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

As for what I have read that Danny Dyer is having time off because he is ""exhausted"" - what more has he done than any of the other actors to get in this situation? Poor Dot puts in more effort than he does and still she soldiers on.

17/02/2017,"Just now, anything centring on the pub and the no-hope Carters is dreary and depressing. Their 'supper club' nights are embarrassing, and last night's was no exception. The place is due for a fire or a bombing or another bus crash, so I wish they'd get on with it. Michelle and her toyboy are implausible and slightly sickening and I'm hoping Bex does not now become enamoured of Preston. For my taste, anything revolving around the local teens is my cue to switch off mentally. Kim drives me mad but for once seems to be showing a smidgen of empathy for her 'sister' - may it continue in a more positive way. Why has Dot's house become a substitute cr̬che and launderette - something nasty brewing there. I long for some good fortune and positivity, it is so rare.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

21/02/2017,Eastenders has really improved in the past few months after years of being pretty rubbish. I watched it from the early days in the 80s and 90s but then only dipped in and out until recently (as it has now become more watchable again). Yesterday's episode was okay.

23/02/2017,I think that the programme needs to get new writers for this soap. The storylines are boring (especially Kim & Denise). The characters do not portray real life. Is it not time that there was a new landlord in the pub as the Carter family are all boring ! Time for big change please.,15243149,EastEnders,2,53,1

23/02/2017,When are the writers actually going to visit east London ??????????????The whole soap is now just Left Wing statements about immigration and the like I am white English live in East London and am an ethnic MINORITY !!!!!!!!!!!!!There is no storyline apart from a leaking roof and now Dot crashing her car which she would not be allowed to do as she is a pensioner who has bad eyes and would have to retake her driving test to get a license !!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is more realism and enjoyable everyday scenes rather than too frequent over-the-top sensationalist stunts, which is a welcome improvement. I'm particularly enjoying the re-building of the Fowler/Beale families - it's nice to have a return to some of the main original families. Whilst I'm still getting used to the recast Michelle, I'm willing her to work. She does actually look a lot like the old actress does now. The accent isn't exactly right but it isn't impossible for accents to change after so many years so I'll try to overlook that. I'm not sure how I feel about her inappropriate relationship - but think it might be interesting if the storyline related it to her own relationship with Dirty Den when she was just 16.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

Also, this episode was an eye opener for all of the drivers who have a medical condition that has not been disclosed to the DVLA. Furthermore, Ian Beale looks overweight anyway and should stay off fatty foods and get rid of the extra tonnage. I shall scream if his doctors say he has diabetes. Type 2 diabetes should be renamed to something else because anyone with Type 1 diabetes is branded as ""one of them who is draining the NHS funds"". Not so, Type Ones are totally different and are insulin dependent whilst the others can control it by diet or tablets.

Also feel it makes it more difficult for the writers, there are relatively few people in it in a small area and how on earth can they managed to write so much about it which is why, I guess some of the stories are a bit 0TT.",10677562,EastEnders,2,72,9

28/02/2017,"Eastenders has really improved these last few months after years of poor quality. It has become relatively watchable again and I'm watching regularly for the first time since the early 2000s (having watched from the 80s when it started). I like the attempts at better realism - more everyday scenes and issues, just everyday lives and events, which is great because one-off irregular stunts and/or ""disasters"" have much more impact than regular, too frequent stunts. It is also nice to see everyday drama - something you can relate to like Ian's health issues (I'm thinking perhaps Type 2 diabetes). The nasty bully teenagers are, sadly, very realistic. As a Londoner, I have witnessed very similar teenagers.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

As for Kim i thought she was excellent and getting funnier by the minute. At first i didnt get her but she is a good actress, So good at comedy too. Mick is still Mick not like his character should be (Hard). It is so obvious that Whitney is going to go with Mick! Why do Eastenders have to give so many clues to the audience as though they are dense? This could happen in a more subtle way. Also a comment made by a viewer ie WHEN DID EASTENDERS CHANGE INTO GRANGE HILL is correct? Get rid of the teenage school episodes please. Although the rotten kid is a good actor but this scene could have happened in the shop anyway",10639595,EastEnders,2,71,7

I did not like the way that the programme ended! With Whitney looking wistful after Mick, I do hope they do not get together. Shirley looking after her mother is very fraught! her sister's accident was very difficult for her. She was so tired, being awake all night. It is an all too familiar situation; to people who have older relatives to look after; especially with Altsiemers. Poor old Ian worried to death about his health; especially as he is 48 to day and his Farher died at 48. So many Storylines are on the go at the moment! All good.",10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

I think the best that could come of this would be total disaster forcing them to quit the pub and move directly to jail or possibly Watford, bring in a new, efficient, upbeat regime - people with IQs in double figures. Michelle is reaping the dubious rewards of her misdemeanours with Preston and I sense a showdown between her and Preston's mother. I do however, feel rather sad and sorry for Bex, product of a broken home a belligerent father and an absent mother, her little life is in turmoil and she is one of the few decent characters who has a spark of intelligence, conscience and talent.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

The story of sending nude/topless pictures over any media has the potential to go horribly wrong for the children sending/receiving them. This issue has been addressed well and children possibly will take more notice than if lectured about it by parents/teachers. I am pretty fed up with the shenanigans in the Vic. Mick in particular is doing my head in, this is not a normal response (in my view) to an adult dealing with a run of bad luck. My feelings on this are compounded by gambling as a way to sort out his own financial crisis.",10813281,EastEnders,2,60,7

With better scripts the current storylines could be infinitely more engaging. Not actually caring about 7/8th of the characters doesn't help hold one's interest. The issues being tackled are important ones to so many people, I just wish they were better handled and less alarmist.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

14/03/2017,so glad that Eastenders appears to be highlighting the appalling situation over the care of Alzheimers/Dementia sufferers and their families. I know from bitter experience just how difficult it is to know the best course of actions regards caring for a loved one and the apparent 'non-existence' of help from social services. How Sylvie has managed to slip through the net as the Carter's obviously have no savings to speak of and should be being helped.

17/03/2017,Not easy watching but the bullying scene certainly got the important message across - some great acting from all concerned and cetainly highlighted the fact that bullies lie and the 'establishment' takes the easy path - I would be happy to see some 'hints' involved on how staff could effectively learn the truth and then issue a Powerful Message to the Bullies by inflicting Serious Punishment for the Bullies (who are always Cowards) and also 'hnts' as to how to support the Victim....Well handled but hope for more 'Punch'!,14199082,EastEnders,2,65,8

17/03/2017,I'm really impressed with the Bex storyline. The bullies are really nasty girls but sadly this is realistic and it's good that Eastenders is highlighting this sort of thing - and doing it well (in a realistic but not overly sensationalist manner). Bex is played by a great actress - very believable (and Louise is acting well too). Eastenders has been so much improved the past 4 or so months - I so hope this continues.,14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

17/03/2017,"The bullying of Bex is really distressing, but an important story to explore. The chaos in the pub is deeply tedious, hysterical and I didn't blame Linda for leaving it behind to return to her mother. What a hopeless bunch. The Branning family have always been a devious bunch, hardly surprising with a patriarch like Max. Lauren at least is permitted to have a brain, but she is a totally unsympathetic character. Caring for Sylvie is another distressing thread that has been dragged out far too long. The woman must be placed into care before everybody goes completely mad.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

17/03/2017,@ the moment EastEnders is great with exceptions to the bullying and the sexual pictures that's going around school another way of bullying by the internet but the bullies get away with it all the time cause as far as they are concerned is that they are just having fun. It might be fun for those girls and those lads to do what their doing cause when a picture was circulated about the young lad whom posted the picture of Becky from shakier s phone didn't like it and he told Becky to take it down. So he should be made to take down the pictures he posted online about Becky and Becky should have said that to him but it could result in Becky Attempting to take her own life cause its gone to far and I know how she feels cause I was in the same situation when I was a young school child @ the age of 14 up to 17 yrs old and I did ty to take my own life when I went home after school. Cause I was rushed to the hospital cause I took my mums medication put all her medication in to scrambled egg and I had eaten it before any knew and they only knew cause I collapsed @ my friends home and they only knew cause I told them before I passed out. And now I suffer from Depression and I am on tablets for the depression from te doctor and I have been seen by the mental health team @ my local hospital when I very nearly chopped my left hand off then I chewed my middle finger down to the bone so you never really get over it completely.,14371179,EastEnders,1,57,10

Lauren seems to be having doubts about her relationship so this could change a lot of relationships on the square. I think the blackmail scenario of Denny and Michelle does not ring true, I think any hold Denny has on Michelle would not have been enough to make Michelle give in to any demands he might make. At some point I think she would call his bluff and just say he was lying and I think most adults would believe her over a child.",2632340,EastEnders,1,69,7

For the first time in years I'm watching regularly (I watched the early days in the 80s and 90s but then only dipped in and out because it became rather rubbish). The only silly thing about yesterday however was Denise just walking out of her job. In reality unless you were comfortable financially you wouldn't just walk out because you were asked to do a training course. She won't be able to claim benefits for a while because of resigning so how will she cope financially? She'll also struggle to find a new job because she won't get a decent reference after the way she walked out.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

23/03/2017,"The story mill is grinding so slowly and so predictably. The young go their own stupid way as do most of the adults. Whitney is right to be worried about the behaviour of Lauren who appears incapable of seeing the mayhem she could create. Denise is in a cleft stick as to whether she should succumb to the lovely Kush and incur his mother's wrath. The Carters are annoying and seemingly doomed as is the wretched Michelle. I wish she would go away and drag Preston with her. The Beales are smug and unamusing. I can't stand Kim, but at least she raises a few laughs.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

This soap usually leaves me feeling vaguely depressed because I actually don't feel empathy with more than three or four of the characters. I do feel for Tina for being part of the fairly horrific bunch, the Carter tribe. Whitney has a kind heart. Denise is a tryer and deserves her day in the sun. All of the Beale/Fowler/Mitchell clan, with the exception of Billy, are pretty loathsome, I wish Michelle would disappear, likewise Ben, Denny and bossy Sharon, at least we are having a break from Phil throwing his considerable weight around. There was a stab of humour in the interview scene, but it was an opportunity missed - idiotic stereotypes. But who would want to share accommodation with Ben Mitchell?

I don't like that Preston was turned on by all Michelle's family and friends - he is only a 17 year old boy and still quite vulnerable (especially as he was on his own in a foreign county). I think the storyline would be more understandable if the producer referred to Michelle's teenage relationship with Den Watts - perhaps this gave her inappropriate attitudes to teenage/adult relationships.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

It's abuse! Although difficult to watch, I am pleased that bullying is being given a spotlight because it is a huge problem in society today. It has always existed but with Social Media, the lack of support & schools/parents not addressing the problem effectively, it seems to have got out of hand... Not sure what to make of the Denise/Kushy debarcle... All I know is I wish they would just stop snogging so much! It was actually embarrassing - GET A ROOM!!

I have read that she didn't want to return as Michelle and gave her blessing for the recasting. I think they should have found an actress for the part who looks more like Susan.

13/04/2017,I like the way the bullying storyline is being acted - it's very convincing and very relevant to young people these days. A very good storyline. It was really moving the way it ended with Bex sobbing. I'm not sure about the Denise/Kush storyline - after just having an unwanted baby I'm not sure someone would act to carefree. But I liked the dinner party at Kim's scenes.,13738991,EastEnders,2,66,9

I do not think for one minute she would even go for a guy like that. That is what makes it so silly. Also what has happened to the Career of Denis?? Thought that was the idea of the abortion, she wanted to make something of her life. Eastenders do not set a good example of women. She has gone straight into having sex straight away with Cush. You really wouldnt if you didnt want another child would you? This is getting silly. Also milking the lovers is quite excruciationg.

18/04/2017,"Really good tonight - so glad that the 'bullying' issue is being resolved, although more emphasis on exactly what the school are doing & support offered for the victim would be better. Shirley's coming out of Prison for the Funeral was a little weird... I didn't think they let anyone just walk out of Prison for a Funeral but maybe I missed something in another episode. Was a little confused byt the 'Donna lending a spanner from the Garage' thing but there's obviously something coming with that... As usual great acting & storylines that keep you guessing...",13884919,EastEnders,2,50,10
18/04/2017,"If anyone is going to get this bullying sorted, it's that gobby Sonia. Bex, though full of mouth when addressing her seniors (out of order, disrespectful and not disciplined - story of most of todays youth) she is not brave enough to take on those gobby teenage bullies. Let's hope we have seen the last of these awful children because that is all they are - children - and must be corrected before they end up in a remand home. It is high time that more discipline is brought into schools and respect begins at home.",2656293,EastEnders,1,77,10

18/04/2017,Im sad that Sonia the character had only a two day part because as a rampaging mum of a bullied child she could have brought about a satisfactory conclusion to the subject instead of the fizzle that was left last night. It would have been nice to have seen the bullies properly and publicly punished and the school re-thinking their strategy about future bullying. This was the ideal opportunity for the producers and script writers to highlight a growing and very worrying problem that is endemic nationwide.,14188051,EastEnders,2,58,7

20/04/2017,"One of the great problems I have with the series is that there is scarcely a character I care about and most of them either disgust me or annoy me. I have never warmed to the Branning girls, neither of them, but with a father like Max what chance have they had, it must have been every woman for herself in their house growing up and never a decent example to live up to. Lauren in portrayed as a completely selfish air head creature who is clearly going to flit from partner to partner as the whim takes her. I actually pity Steven and her poor baby. The plight of the Carters leaves me unmoved except for the poor dog. Ben and Jay are unlikeable and vapid and if I were Donna their flat is the last place I'd wish to be. Perhaps she can encourage the strengthening of Ben's backbone. I do not want to see a reconciliation between Bex and Louise, Louise is a Mitchell therefore not to be trusted to be decent.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

It would be kinder to put the Dog down. I have not made my mind up about Woody yet, I got a bit worried when ...... Cannot think of his name got a huge knife out. He was going to stab the condom, what a rat! I was very surprised that Jay was so negative about having some one in a wheel chair living with them. I thought he was more caring than that.

21/04/2017,"Eastenders has been much better for the past few months (after years of being a bit rubbish). I think it has really benefited from the clear-outs - Ronnie & Roxy were irritating and dull characters, and I've enjoying the absence of Phil, and to an extent Mick and Linda. Shirley is (and has always been) the best and most interesting Carter, although Johnny seems okay and has potential, and Tina has been much more likeable in the past few months. Whitney needs to go - or at least leave the Carters alone. It is absolutely ridiculous that she is pretty much taking over the fmaily -she was married to Mick's son for a few months, and the fact that she went to Sylvie's funeral instead of Lee was just downright offensive (and rather silly). Finally, I do hope that the dog, Lady Di, is okay. I won't be happy if there is a sad ending. The scenes with Lauren in Canary Wharf were a bit silly - I've lived in London all my life and have worked in the past in the Canary Wharf area - and unless it has been evacuated the area would never be that empty of crowds! Also it was silly that Lauren got the interview - nowadays you need about 10 degrees and 2 masters just to get an entry-level position espcially in a company like that. Although I suppose it is just about believable if the storyline is that Josh (and/or Max) has pulled strings to get her the interview/job. I also really dislike Lauren now. What a hypocrite - slapping Josh because she ""doesn't like liars"" yet she hasn't told him about her boyfriend and baby (not to mention what she is doing to Steven by cheating). On a more positive note, Ben and Jay continue to be great - excellent bromance, great rapport, good screen presence, interesting and compelling charaters, and I intially though Donna wouldn't work with them but she does (although the writers clearly haven't experienced private renting if they think it's that easy to just move out with no notice even if boilers don't work).",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

The lad, who is an avid fan, also reckons that it has got worse since the change of producer and that he has no ideas at all. For him to say that about his favourite show speaks volumes. The producer and storylines are slowly alienating the following that it has and will soon become defunct on the TV guide if it carries on in the same vein. Personally that would suit me but for those that enjoy the programme it will be gutting.",1193480,EastEnders,1,55,1

02/05/2017,"Eastenders has been better the past few months (since around December) than it has been for years, but the past week or so hasn't been great. The new character, Woody, seems a bit unnecessary (especially for The Vic). He would surely have been the one to sack rather than anyone else because he's only been there about a week and they already have one bar manager, Sharon. Also surely Whitney would have been made redundant over Tracey. Whitney was married to one of the Carter sons for a few months and would not have moved in with his family after they split. I also found it a bit ridiculous that Tracey would a) Bother travelling by bus on a half hour or longer journey for a bar job that would involve travelling at night at around 1am (after pub close-up) when bar work is generally minimum wage and so she would likely find work in a bar closer to home and also b) They writers clearly have no idea about being on a low income because you could barely afford to rent a room in a shared house on barstaff wages so Tracey having a mortgage was a bit unrealistic - although I suppose she could have done a right-to-buy on a council home.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

What will the repercussion's of Sharon leaving them alone and her Denny being in the house, Will we see Phil appear again? Jack finds himself in a very difficult situation, With his brother Max scheming to get Charlie back into Matthew's life, a difficult question to ask Jack! What will Dot do. I like Lauren's storyline she is a foolish girl no telling what her Father will do to make life difficult for her.

04/05/2017,"Addressing bullying through soaps is a great way to highlight what can happen and perhaps make others see what a bully looks like and how all the parties involved are affected.I think Louise and Rebecca have played their roles extremely well and given very convincing performances. I think the show was let down by the ridiculous portrayal of Dee rummaging about in a bin for food. She has a sister and a boyfriend she could share her situation with and is a grown adult, not some inarticulate idiot.",10813281,EastEnders,2,60,9

The Closing of the Community Centre is having a big effect on Welford; when are they going to protest; For people like Louise that use it a lot Having to pay �10 to go on the tube is out of their hands, if they do not have the money; Denise will have to give up her ambitions; to better herself. I could not believe the storyline last night; Louise not accepting those two scheming school friends spiked her drink. Then we learnt the poor chap who saved her, by telling Becks; has been charged with the spiking the drinks and surprise, surprise an empty Vodka bottle has been found in his locker!! Max is another scheming individual, getting Charlie back into Matthew's life, no telling what he will do next! Poor Old Lady Di, I think I will be proved right and she will die before the Operation; she is in a bad place and old. Very enjoyable evening.",10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

Firstly Denise storyline - ridiculous, she would go and sign on whilst looking for a job not be starving herself just so ridiculous. Also, what has happened to Vincents character?? When he arrived he was a hardman, a gangster who got rid of Charlie Cotton and was feared - now he is a just a muse to Kim and has no role, he was a hard man where has that gone? He was someone who was watchable and had a back story now he is just a joke, and Charlie turning up - didn't Vincent and Ronnie frighten him off? WHere is the storyline continuity?? PLEASE let this bullying storyline come to an end - let Louise see how awful those girls are and end this once and for all, this is Eastenders, not Waterloo Road - they have bought Cathy back from the dead but she has no storyline whatsoever, Michelle is just awful, where is Phil? Is he ever coming back? There are no strong characters that you love and follow anymore - bring back Kat and Alfie, bring back Roxy and Ronnie from the dead (they did it with Dallas!) or just sack this new producer as he is ruining the show- get someone with a bit of OOmph owning and running the Queen Vic again - another Peggy or Alfie - maybe Max should own it??

I think that Carmel/ Kush are stupid characters. In real life Kush would have been more firm about telling his mum to back off from his relationships. I think that the actors who play these characters are good, unlike my feelings for the characters they portray. As for the Whitney storyline -let's just hope that once the divorce comes through , she will leave the programme. Sometimes it is time for characters to depart from the programme as their character does very little for the programme. The other character I would love to see leave the show, is Kim. She is mouthy, cannot even talk properly. Her language must give viewers the idea that we Londoners are actually from Essex !!

The silly scripts when one of them has phoned or been phoned are becoming less believable and the trip that Woody and Whitney made to collect their son for his birthday seemed a good example.

Sad about Denise and her encounter with Cora at the food bank - but it should not have deterred her, heavan knows Cora has been in dire straits herself and would not have judged Denise - so just a bit unlikely. Sad also that Kush is not pursuing Denise and allowing himself to be steered into a dating system he clearly is not keen on. Ian is intolerable and deluded, I feel Jane may be driven to poisoning him. He's a cheat and a coward and has eaten himself into his current difficulties so maybe it will serve as a lesson to the pie-eaters. Utterly fed up with the Jack saga and failing to understand why clearing up a few toys and tidying the sitting room is such a problem for him.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

Apart from a few (honey, Billy' Sharon, Phil) naming a few, the majority are the most dreadful actors, as for the new bar manager, what are they thinking!! For goodness sake, get some decent actors in, some decent believable storylines and maybe it could be the decent programme it was when it first started. I, and everyone I know, have stopped watching it, that is the last episode I shall watch until changes are made.

As for this business with Denise, anyone else who hadn't eaten for two weeks would be unconsious by now, too weak to do anything.

Lots of people suffer from it & it can be easily controlled but you have to take care of yourself... Poor Denise! I really feel for her.. I too have been in a similar situation but I turned to my family for help. They bought my food for me but had I not had their support (and I am lucky because not everyone has family to turn to), then I would have HAD to use a Foodbank. I am still struggling to believe that in 2017, here in the UK, Foodbanks are necessary! A complete failing of the government to support the vulnerable & poverty stricken members of our society! I also have had no heat all Winter, so completely understand Denise's situation... As for poor Jack - his own Brother is the instigator of his current situation.. Evil Max!

This is exactly what is happening every day to many thousands of people. Denise through no fault of her own unemployment, sactions applied, no common sense approach in genuine cases such as Denise by DWP. It is to be hoped that many of the MP's atanding for election watched this storyline, as this will outline exactly what is taking place. In another programme i.e. news, reporter interviewed re. general election and one older gentleman stated that the overseas fund is paying out to foreign countries, whilst as is outlined in eastenders as an example of what is taking place in our Country - as it is not sufficient audit and control of overseas money is taking place.",1706226,EastEnders,2,70,8

19/05/2017,liked the fact that it highlighted the need for foodbanks and I will donate something when I next go shopping,16002889,EastEnders,2,52,9
19/05/2017,"I think it's great that the BBC is trying to highlight the dreadful situation this country is currently in where so many people are not given sufficient incomes for the dignity of buying their own food (and are being forced to go to food-banks, which should not exist because people should earn enough or get enough benefits to not need them). I suppose my only slight criticism is the concern that some people watching might think that some people using foodbanks don't need to (Denise could ask her sister, Kim, for some help - especially as she has helped Kim out in the past, including pretty much bringing her up), and also she could perhaps get a lodger in, however it is good that the programme is highlighting the shocking situation where people (many of whom, like Denise, have paid tax for years) are denied at benefits at all or face delays. I accept people shouldn't be able to just walk out of jobs and receive lots of money but generally people don't walk of jobs for no reason (it's depressing being out of work, and Denise's children have grown-up so she wants a job to have a purpose in life) and people should at least have enough for food and other essentials (i.e. gas, electricity, phone bill- to apply for jobs, etc). I do however wonder why Kim hasn't wondered how Denise is managing because Kim knows Denise isn't working anymore. Meanwhile, Max is now horrible and I hope his plan fails and Charlie makes up with Jack and they decide to share custody of Matthew.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

He was shocked to find Whitney in bed with Woody; he told Woody to get out, was this perhaps because Mick is jealous? The story about Denise and her desperate need for money to buy food and going to a food bank where she meets up with Cara who has also suffered similar problems has shown how this situation is being played out by many people in the UK right now. So it is a real story and so far has been well scripted, much more to come.",2632340,EastEnders,1,69,9

Why is this when it is all there for the taking and can be brilliant!!! i cannot believe they cannot make it good. I do not think for one minute that Mick as a character would go nuts when he couldn't even gather any money at all when the roof was falling in on them.? Also that he can be unfaithful to Linda, which is just looming it is so obvious. The Whitney storyline is a bit unbelievable. I cannot believe this storyline either. Shirley and Denise are the only ones in this soap who are a bit believable. Maybe Micks son in the pub. He is a believable character and a good actor. The rest are a bit of a non entity at the moment. Do not know what is happening with Max. Vengeance?",10639595,EastEnders,2,71,6

Steven what an awful thing to do to tear that beautiful Dress of Lauren's. He is too weird for me. She must leave him as soon as Possible! I do hope she is not pregnant. with all that Condon Stabbing!! I do hope that Mick and Whit do not get together! Dot is trying her hardest; with these no good relations of hers and her late Husband Jim. Poor little Matthew! piggy in the middle.

23/05/2017,"I've been watching Eastenders again for about 5 or 6 months now (after not watching regularly for years). It's okay but has it's ups and downs. I'm not really looking forward to Steven Beale going ""evil"" again (I saw a spoiler by accident on social media). I don't really enjoy over-the-top sensationalist storylines like that, and it annoys me that the producers are apparently trying to excuse Lauren's cheating by making her boyfriend ""evil"" instead of just having Lauren break-up with Steven if she no longer feels attracted to him. Whitney is horrific and I just want her written out now. It is ridiculous that she is still living with the Carters. She was married to Mick's son for a very brief period - and should not be living with his family now. Also the way she is desperately going after Mick is appalling. She sent Linda away in a very manipulative manner a few weeks ago and is now complaining that Mick ""left"" her to spend time with his daughter who was injured! Mick annoys me too - I would prefer he, Linda, and Phil Mitchell all left the show (I haven't missed any of them).",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,6

So happy to see Denise's tutor being kind to her and to see her reunited with dear old Patrick who will try to sort out the financial situation. Cannot care about Jack and family, I'll be glad when little Matthew is finally whisked away by his natural father and away from the confines of the unluckiest square in London",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

Denise and her downward spiral, Lauren and Steven's non-existent relationship and it's downward spiral, the Carters and their numerous downward spirals. All that nonsense with Alex and Madison bullying Bex and manipulation Louise. Michele and her downward spiral.

The Jack/Charlie/Matthew saga seems on the point of resolution, but perhaps it's not been milked of every ounce of pathos and there will be plenty of opportunities for skeletons in cupboards to pop out in the future. i don't want Dot to disappear to Ireland - who would be left when there's a need for quoting chapter and verse?

12/06/2017,"I watch this programme because an elderly member of my household loves it, she likes me to sit with her when it's showing. I should not watch at all were it not for her. I think my main reason for disliking it is that so few of the characters are likeable and there is always so much strife, tragedy, spite and sometimes violence. At the moment I am tremendously bored with the Carters and their hangers-on, the Beales except for Jane who has a brain and a good heart, all of the Mitchells (although Billy and Honey are harmless) I mentally tune out when the story threads of the teenage schoolkids occur (far too much of them) I quite admire Denise and Patrick but the rest of the family is intolerably dreadful. Last night the most interesting moment was the final shot of the man Michelle was eyeing on the tuve. Max and Lauren and sister Abi need therapy, they are equally appalling.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,7

15/06/2017,"Continuing on its downward spiral, the new family are appalling and I really have no desire or interest in watching them,as the East End of London has become increasingly trendy I really dont think this is representative of the type of family who would be moving onto the Square, it would make a refreshing change to have some slightly more upmarket characters for a change. Ugly people and wooden acting are not a winning combination, they would look far more home in Coronation Street. I am very disappointed in how this once excellent programme is being systematically destroyed by the new producer",15642097,EastEnders,1,59,6

Max told her that her boss was engaged to be married, something that he had not told her. Louise has come to terms that she was raped or that is what she has been told and she had been to the hospital and she was not pregnant but there was also the chance she had been given chlamydia. Hopefully this will warn girls of a similar age to be very careful particularly with regards to the possibility of a drink being spiked.",2632340,EastEnders,1,69,8

I think, with a very few notable exceptions, that the populace of the Square have become contaminated by some kind of creeping dishonesty and selfishness. How can people be so blind to the glaring faults and viciousness of their families and those supposedly close to them. The young are a loathsome bunch and mostly their parents are stupid and know nothing about discipline or empathy. Totally implausible.",2781437,EastEnders,2,74,6

The problems when Sonia actually got her into Hospital, it was a very true picture of the reality of the happenings in many A & E Departments. For Dot having drunks coming into her cubicle was very frightening for her. The Story line of Derek and his situation; as an older Gay Man, the sordid he had to live after his conviction; due to his relationship with a 20year old Man. I thought the worst part was when he said; that when he came out of prison; the Man did not acknowledge him and had even got married while he was in Prison. Very, very sad; shows life as it is and was!! Thank you East enders bringing all these problems to the fore. Helps you understand the World as it is.",10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

I get that maybe she will be coming back after the birth of her baby & they're keeping her in the storyline BUT just to say she's caring for her Mother is fine.. Mick can go visit & I would be happy with that but to keep the silly reasons is actually silly! Love the new 'NHS in Crisis' storyline with poor Dot & the fact that nobody was looking out for her...

29/06/2017,Dot was taken to hospital with a broken hip and Patrick feels very guilty as he hadn't checked more thoroughly. Robbie has made quite an entrance with the market traders and he is known to most of them. Not sure how Robbie will get on with them all as he is in some ways their boss. Mick is keen to get Lynda home but I think she is staying away a lot longer than she needs to.,2632340,EastEnders,1,69,9
29/06/2017,There are almost too many lines at the moment. I am finding the 'new' version of Robbie Jackson highly entertaining. Nice to see the original actor returning to play the character.,16185819,EastEnders,2,75,7

29/06/2017,"I've heard that the current producer (who has only been there for a year) is already leaving. This is such a shame because, whilst I know some viewers (younger ones, I think) didn't seem to like the direction he has taken Eastenders in, I have much preferred it. I've actually started watching regularly again for the first time in over 10-15 years. It is much more realistic with everyday scenes (it will never be as good at the first 10 years, but is more like the earlier days than it used to). I like the lack of over-the-top sensationalist stunts. I suppose perhaps there could have been slightly less ""eductional/preaching"" in the storyline last night - Dot waiting for a hospital bed - not because I found it annoying (because I understand why this issue has been highlighted because it does happen and is awful and should be sorted out by the government) but because I know some viewers might get annoyed. I really like the return of Robbie and Sonia. I used to find Sonia a bit annoying (although I never hated her - unlike her dreadful sister, Bianca, who I never warmed to) but she's been good so far, and much preferable to Stacey. Robbie has been a good comedy character so far - I like that he is now market maanager albeit in a slightly David Brent style. I also don't miss Phil, and it's been good without Linda Carter. I also thought it was good to highlight the homophobia of the past and how dreadfully gay men were treated only fairly recently. It's shocking that those criminilised for being gay like Derek's character have not had their convictions quashed retrospectively.",14982633,EastEnders,2,41,7

03/07/2017,I don't think there's much to say that I haven't said before. I still can't understand how so many people/families can have the number of problems the residents of Albert Square seem to have. What amazes me is the fact that they all have their problems at the same time.,14316033,EastEnders,2,64,8

03/07/2017,"I like this show, the characters and stories in it seem more real to me. The problem I have with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, is that I often feel I am watching comedy characters trying to do serious stuff. I don't get that feeling with Eastenders.

03/07/2017,"I've been really enjoying Eastenders again since Christmas. I was a regular viewer from the early days in the 80s but stopped watching regularly around 10-15 years ago (just dipped in and out after that). It had improved massively for the past 6 months or so, but the last week or so has seen a drop in quality. Yesterday's episode was ridiculous and quite frankly annoying. The ""Norwegian"" nanny was blatantly not Norwegian and it's a little offensive to real Norwegians to have an English actress put on a fake (and poorly done) Norwegian accent and then play up both English Eastend and Norwegian cliches. The Taylor mum was also ridiculous yesterday. It was as if a middle-class writer who has never really encoutered a ""chav""/benefit family in real-life wanted to write a parody of this sort of family - i.e. ""we come across as ""chavs"" but actually we're all salt of the earth decent people underneath"". Tosh! Plenty of decent working-class people and also plenty of people genuinely claiming benefits due to bad luck, but there are also some pretty unpleasant ""chav"" types around too. Whether decent or not, no family/mum of that sort of family would be so stereotyped. I hope yesterday's episode was just a blip and things get better again.",14982633,EastEnders,2,42,5
03/07/2017,"Still think the Queen Vic storyline is spoiling the programme. I t's just going on and on. Still having trouble translating what Mick Carter is mumbling on about. What's 'a cockle?'

11/07/2017,It just seems to take so long for anything to happen. A storyline is started and proceeds to ferment through conversations and long lingering looks. These girls who are causing trouble seem to have been going on forever. I suppose if anything happened quickly the writers would have a problem coming up with enough new topics.

11/07/2017,"Eastenders has been so much improved since around Christmas. I've been watching regularly for the first time in around 15 years. I very much like the more real feel of the show - the everyday realism, which is how it used to be back in the 80s and early 90s. I don't enjoy soaps when they have too many over-the-top sensationalist storylines and/or stunts/disasters, etc. I would prefer not to have the Evil Steven and Evil Abi storyline because it is too panto baddy for my taste, and also it's a real shame to have ruined Abi's character like this because until a couple of years ago she was a lovely and very likeable sweet character. The bullies are absolutlely horrible but I think it's a very good storyline because sadly this is very realistic so it's good to highlight it (although I do very much hope the two nasty girls and Keegan get their comeuppance).",14982633,EastEnders,2,42,6

Abi is trying to split them up because she fancies Steven herself but I think there is also a part of her that wants to punish her sister who seems to have every thing that she wants but can't have.,2632340,EastEnders,1,69,9

Denise tries to keep the holiday plans quite but Kushes mum finds out and sparks could fly, she has a drink with Max who maybe she's contemplating maybe a relationship, who knows but again that storyline could go further. Lauren tries to get Steven to listen to her as she wants to end their relationship, of course Abby hopes theres something in it for her, we'll have to see what effect when he gets told.

13/07/2017,"Love to watch, cannot believe the state of Steven. Pathetic really. If they depict real people I am glad I don't know them",13303146,EastEnders,2,58,5

14/07/2017,"This story re. Lauren has been building forever, but now has reached a height - also a little annoying height because it means it will drag on AGAIN. This is the only thing I dislike in a soap.

14/07/2017,"I can't help watching Eastenders although the storylines are becoming very predicable.

14/07/2017,"Eastenders has been pretty good for the past 7 or so months. I started watching again at Christmas time after not watching properly for about 10-15 years. The past few weeks haven't been great but I do enjoy and like the more realistic/realism feel of the programme (something it used to have in the 80s and 90s) and hope this continues. Keegan is a nasty bully and I hope he (with Alexandra and Madison) gets his comeuppance. Michelle went up in my estimation - I liked her getting rid of him at the end of the show and protecting Dennis. I do feel very sorry for Bernadette though. She is not like her brother and seems quite sweet. The Steven/Abi/Lauren/Josh thing is a bit annoying. It's a shame Steven has become a pantomine baddie (this first happened some years ago when he shot Jane - but I suppose he could have been rehabilitated but sadly this isn't to be). Also it is such a terrible shame how Abi's character has been ruined the past 2 or 3 years. She used to be such a lovely sweet girl and I'd rather she had't been made into a pantomine baddie. Having said that, at this stage seeing how both of them are so weird and baddies, they might as well just get them together.",14982633,EastEnders,2,42,7
14/07/2017,Lauren is all set to leave Woolford and to just walk out on Steve and Abi as usual is trying to make him give up on Lauren and to commit to her as she would be much better for him than Lauren could ever be.

What happened to looking on the bright side of life. Life isn't all hell on earth, depressing and to be honest boring, good things need to happen as well to show that life is worth living. As it stands Eastenders is heading for the crematorium all it needs is one more nail in the coffin, and another show that used to be happy and sad will as the saying goes ""bite the dust"". We need a happy birth, a happy engagement, a happy wedding. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY NOT DEPRESSING, SAD AND NASTY. Phil Mitchell go back to Italy if you can't be nice.",10797998,EastEnders,2,56,7

Why does Max want the chippy when Ian is selling it anyway and what's with all this stuff about the council got to do with the price of eggs?

In the Beale home are many undercurrents, not least Steven's manipulation of the dopey sisters Branning, the prospect of Ian and Jane departing the Square for a bungalow in Essex is too good to look forward to.

03/08/2017,"I honestly thought they would let the storyline with Louise & Lisa play out a little longer... I thought that what Sharon said to Phil after leaving the hotel room was quite powerful - that he had played a huge part in Lisa's problems! I really loved her character in Eastenders prior to her departure & I hope that they follow up on the more serious side of her mental health issues & not just leave it! A very sad situation indeed & Louise as an innocent, will also suffer as a result. The scenes with Witney & Mick were brilliant.. but I am a little confused because Woody is supposedly having an affair with Ell... so what on earth is going on?! Maybe more light will be shed on this if Ell comes home, as Mick asked last night! I thought the twist with Evil Max & Steven was pretty good - 'lets see what happens in 3 months when you are supposed to die from a brain tumour'! & then Max smiles... It's actually not funny at all because there is a more serious side to this BUT Max was really the last person that needed to know about this terrible lie.. Brilliant from the marvelous Eastender's cast & an award for Lisa's fantastic portrayal of a woman in complete turmoil due to her mental health problems - just brilliant!",13884919,EastEnders,2,50,10

18/08/2017,OK,15437750,EastEnders,2,51,7
18/08/2017,I did not like the bit where Phil is behaving so badly he is quite frightening. Poor Honey nearly fainted. His acting is good; but to tell Jay he killed his Father; that must have been devastating for him; will he ever recover from that revelation; very difficult I would think. That dreadful manipulating Steven; surely Abi must get rid of him sooner rather than later; I hope. What a pity the Hubbard family have had the Kybosh put on their holiday; What part did Max have on this Storyline and his Red Dress Floosy. It was rather violent last night!! I must expect it happening in the East End. Still it is not a subject I know much about it; Thank Goodness!! Don't change because I do learn a lot.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

18/08/2017,Awful script writing at the moment - not at all necessary - a good actor/actress stands out and shines regardless of their script - the lady who plays Mrs Taylor is the best by far - Phil Mitchell and Stephen Beale are the worst actors on to in my opinion,15321637,EastEnders,2,50,8

Jamie's acting for the first of the double act between him and Phil was superb but the end let it down as the storyline had no where to go and ended flatly.

28/08/2017,"I'm not too sure about Eastenders at the moment. I'm still continuing to watch for now but might take a break again soon. I'm not at all into all too frequent sensationalist stunts and disasters - and so the trailers for this upcoming disaster is really putting me off the show. Aside from that, yesterday's episode was't too bad - if nothing else for a) The always welcome presence of Shirley - a great character portrayed by a fantastic actress, and b) Whitney getting some sort of comeuppance from Linda. Whitney has no shame continuing to hang around her ex-husband's family especially after having a sort of affair with her father-in-law. Completely inappropriate. Separately, find the Steven Beale fake cancer storyline rather insensitive and not nice at all to watch. It's not only an unpleasant storyline but pretty unrealistic that he would get away with faking it for so long.",14982633,EastEnders,2,42,6

Jay helps Phil and maybe their relationship may start to mend whereas Linda Carter opens up to Jack and says she's had Cancer, never expected that. Martin's fury of not being able to find Stacey ends up with him under arrest for pushing a copper.

07/09/2017,"I think the writers have forgotten how recently a bus crashed into the square! This episode, much like other recent episodes was fragmented, raised more questions than answers and in some instances was bizarre. For example, why would Ian listen to Max rather than follow his own instinct and check on his disabled wife? Why didn't Mick call a taxi to get the woman who tried to kiss him home given his recent marital issues? The writers seem to have story ideas but are thrusting them upon viewers en masse. This is leaving viewers confused and causes them to switch over to other channels.",15454160,EastEnders,2,34,5
07/09/2017,"the most ridiculous episode ever. Every fire engine, ambulance, police car, armed response police car in Lonodn must have been attending the small square for all the different incidents going on.

Eastenders used to be in touch with reality and be believable, it had good acting and well worth itten drama, not cheap sensationalism and out of character behaviour, don't know what the producer and writers were thinking. If I wanted to watch something trashy I'd watch emmerdale! Seriously feel like switching off after watching from the very beginning, this was a bitter disappointment",15642097,EastEnders,1,59,3
08/09/2017,Of course I thought that Jane had perished in the inferno at the Restaurant and then a great surprise Steven just died; the screen just went flat! (Best thing for him) I do fear for Jane's safety now she is alive and Max will not know what to do.( Don't let him smother her with a pillow) It will get very tense I believe. I thought the part Jack played in helping Johnny was so well acted he and Linda together. I thought the miscarriage was a bit too much; one too many storylines; unnecessary; I wonder what other viewers thought. Any how I now cannot wait for Monday night.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

12/09/2017,What I did not like was that there was yet another Story Line Kush having a Cardiac Arrest. There is also the miscarriage storyline that is good but should have been left until later. This should have been later on when all the other story lines were resolved. I fear for Jane even more seeing that Max was trying to twist her airline; thank goodness Ian came in.

12/09/2017,"I'd been a bit behind with eastenders over the summer but caught up on mega week last week. I hadn't known any of it was coming and it felt like a storyline they'd have saved for Christmas and New Year so it was quite unexpected. Some of the drama was a bit far-fetched - the shooting of Johnny, the ambulance getting crashed into by a tanker, the fact no one seemed concerned about Jane being stuck in the restaurant unable to walk and the firefighters not being in any rush to check the building! But the acting has been excellent and I'm really pleased to have Kellie Bright back playing Linda. I also love Fi and think Lisa Faulkner is a brilliant addition to the cast, I'm glad more of her back story is coming into it.",1472653,EastEnders,2,38,8

14/09/2017,I liked the Taylor Family carrying out the little service of remembrance at the Allotment; the burial of the box of remembrance Mother Taylor did redeem herself by talking about all her feelings and Bernie acted in a more mature way. This was all due to Shirley who had a talk with Mother T. Good old Shirley she has some very good traits learned from her chaotic life I did not like the way Linda reacted to what Johnny told her about Ted and Joan; she is a real Tiger Mother; it is not good seeing her going about shouting and carrying on. You have to feel sorry for Joan as Ted has lost his marbles; very sad situation; I hope she will beable to help him. Why does Michelle behave in such a way with Tom; I thought they could have been very Happy.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

Thought the whole scenario of the miscarriage was handled very well showing how Mother was trying to do the best for her daughter, but sadly had the reverse effect. The whole Max situation is just a ticking time bomb, can't be long before he trips himself up or someone starts blabbing. I thought the whole episode with Ted rather hard to believe, the gun, the shooting and then this kind of fugue state he went into.

19/09/2017,I liked this programme. The storylines are exciting and the tension is continuing with new stories being included. I love many of the characters as they are bigger than life and highly entertaining. The actors regularly demonstrate their skills and are entirely convincing. I have watched other soaps in the past and given up within a short time but this is quite compelling.,17176590,EastEnders,2,67,9
19/09/2017,"This is still the better soap, in my opinion, than Corrie and Emmerdale. Eastenders should win all the prizes at the soap awards. My family think some of the storylines are laughable, but I find them more so in the other soaps.",1133621,EastEnders,1,54,8

19/09/2017,I am so pleased that Max is away but do not like the way he texts Ian to see how Jane is. I even felt a bit sorry for Abi last night when they were at the Undertakers as she cannot let her true feelings come out; well not yet any how. Oh dear the Funeral Friday; whatever is going to happen I think Ian is finding out more than he says yet; Poor Stacy and her and Kusch's son. The prognosis is not good is it? She could not tell Martin could she? I do not like the way becks is treating Gethin she is very dangerous to him. Sonia will go off on one when she guesses or is told something; Louise will not be able to keep her mouth shut. Carmel looked well after her Ordeal. I have no Sympathy for Mick when he walked out of the marriage guidance Discussion I would get on and leave him if I was Linda.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

22/09/2017,My goodness what acting last night; thought it was first class; The revelation to Ian Beale and all the family; This was unexpected to me that it was done before the start of the funeral; The reactions of all the family that Steven never had a Brain Tumour was excellent; Abi's face said all she was thinking. Then the second surprise to find Abi in the Church by herself reading the eulogy she written out for Lauren; I found this was scary; will the Beale family ever know who the Father is of her baby! I do wonder how she will handle the situation. The Taylor Family seemed to be so much happier on the son's 16th birthday; what a good idea the scratch card. It looks as though he has a part time Market job as Robbie was there with his lip board; I do hope so. We then move to the Opulence of the Bosses House; I have no idea who he is. Max is in so deep; Sophie and Josh members of the family trying to work out just what they want from the Vic; It is obvious that the Carters will be leaving the series; this is the way of making it happen. This seems to be the new Gangster family that must be feared as the Mitchells were. I was so fearful last night as to what was going to happen next. Can hardly wait until Monday. Thank you for all the surprises Especially when Ian learns who it was that left Jane to die; what will Max do in the meantime.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

25/09/2017,"The only bright spot in this soap at the moment is Bernadette and her family's story at the moment. Whoever is writing this strand has completely refrained from treating this family as a stereotyped family from hell. I love the way in this episode mum tried to hide money troubles from her son, and send him out for money for the electric meter, and then fret about having to turn to a loan shark when his back was turned. It's subtly played and treated with respect and kindness and I recognise the scenario from people and situations I grew up around. Fortunately I escaped such a humble background but repeatedly the scenes for this family ring true because the family is treated with sympathy rather than being the demon family from hell that they were described as in publicity upon their arrival. Their struggles are much more interesting than the panto ""pull down the Square"" villainy that's going on everywhere else. I just hope the writers keep this strand of kitchen sink realism going. it's sorely needed in a programme that elsewhere is just boring and unbelievable.",1229179,EastEnders,1,58,3

What will he think when he learns one day that; Phil was responsible for his Father's death? I could not understand Stacey's outburst when Kush tells her his Father has given him the money and he has bought a defibulator in case Arthur has a Cardiac Arrest!! Kush is Arthur's Father and his Father Arthur's Grandfather. It is not the fault of the children that Stacey has two children with different Father's and expecting another Child with a different Father; what does she expect; only conflict which is her fault. Oh dear did Sharon arrange with Tom to meet up with Michelle again or is he stalking her; and what will happen if he is; very creepy. Can't wait until tonight but I will wait. even if I could see it before. What a Scheming no good is Bernadette trapping.Shaki into coming to the flat on the pretext of meeting her Brother. grabbing him and kissing him when her brother arrives. I despair of her and her feckless mother. I did not like the story line of Dot's meeting with the Vicar; she then learns she has not been told and he is flying to live with his daughter in the afternoon; without even having time to eat a bit of her cake. very cruel I thought. Then in the afternoon poor Dot gets the shock of the new vicar being a Woman! It is a wonder she did not have a heart attack and die on the spot.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

29/09/2017,DREADFUL GETS WORSE HOPE THEY PULL DOWN THE WHOLE SQUARE,1691189,EastEnders,2,67,2
29/09/2017,I am very worried about Tom confronting that poor chap who had; had a date with Michelle; very violent; he is definitely showing a very dark side to his nature. Especially did not like the way he put Michelle's photograph over that of his wife's. This is very good subject to air; the dangers of not knowing; enough about the people they date. from the internet or from Casual acquaintances. I do hope that Arthur was only deeply asleep; not had a cardiac arrest; before they have learnt to use the defibulator. It must be a nightmare for every one living with this condition. and also having the care of some one with it. Thanks for showing us about this disease. Phil and Sharon seem to be so Happy; I do hope it lasts. Jay's change of heart about the car lot. What a sleazy scene of Ben and the other bloke at the Garage. Bernadette is a danger to all the Males in Walford; she definitely needs treatment; Where was her Mother at this time. Story Lines all holding my attention and desperate to watch next episode.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10
29/09/2017,I think the whole plot of revenge by Max on the square is completely TOT and ludicrous.,17306932,EastEnders,2,44,8

29/09/2017,Would be disappointed if I was unable to watch this. Currently it is very fast-paced with storylines moving very quickly but at the same time there is plenty of time to absorb the depth of the stories. The characters mix and mingle throughout the storylines and aren't restricted to their own area. The acting is of a high quality and the characters are interesting and well developed over a period of time. There is nothing that I currently dislike.,17176590,EastEnders,2,67,9

What a situation caused by Stacey having children with different Fathers; that is such a mess for them all. Tom seems to be getting worse; I hope he is not suffering from some mental condition; that will take a turn for worse. The Taylor's Mum seems to be ignoring Bernadette's Post Natal problems; she seems help quickly before she ruins any men's lives. with her accusations. Who is it that is getting at Cathy. Who will stop the Gangs evil plans for Walford who will it be all up to ? I like the story Line of Johnny. Joan and Ted; very human story Line.

06/10/2017,How could Carmel have rung Social Services to say she was worried about Stacey and what she had done to Arthur; The way she keeps questioning Lily is dreadful. Why doesn't she leave her son Kush to sort it out he is Arthur's father. Whatever will the repercussions be for all the family. Also the Social Services Woman having to bring to Policemen with her; so over the top isn't it? if this does happen in real life then we do have a broken society.

09/10/2017,I liked it. It presented some storylines that are not unusual in real life and some are hard to deal with. We hear of some people who claim mental illness to present as their case in defence of an offence. I like that this is being dramatised here. Linda is keeping her illness a secret from Mick and this is not unusual in real life. Again I think this is a good issue to be aired in this type of programme. Most of these issues give food for thoughts do like that a soap opera makes us delve a little into our minds and make us think.,17176590,EastEnders,2,67,9

It really does now need to take a rest probably until the New Year (that way we wont have to put up with the atrocious ""shock death"" on Christmas Day) and it gives the BBC a bit of time to bring in new script writers who do actually know how to write a decent script and also bring in about half a dozen new faces that know how to act.",630477,EastEnders,1,66,5

10/10/2017,Something and nothing really. I like that Stacey isn't having her kids taken away - I've loathed the recent trend where Sean O'Connor just bullied his way in to the characters and made mean things happen to them all. I like that Mick and Linda are getting back on track. I get the impression that the new producer is desperately trying to put things back to make it a watchable programme - I know it still says Sean O'Connor on the credits but there's a feeling that episodes have had scenes inserted and of course there was the famous missing episode a couple of weeks back (even though they deny it!) so I get the sense that it will improve. Hurrah - I've so missed looking forward to Eastenders.,16183768,EastEnders,2,62,3

10/10/2017,What I did not like and that was Max peering through the window; I have to wait two nights before I know whether Jane is safe; she has suffered enough already; God forbid he suffocates her!! I loved the bit at the Allotments with the two old boys Patrick and Ted talking through their problems; afterwards Joan and Ted having a festive meal and even drinking wine; thought that was lovely. Also the sitting on the Sofa with Carmel telling Kush why she rang Social Services; I hope she was telling the truth! So much last night now have two nights to wait.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10

17/10/2017,The storylines are so transparent you can now tell about a fortnight in advance what is going to happen. Very week and drawn out storylines. Very weak acting.

I think the scenes with Martin and Stacey and the baby are very poignant! it must be like that when you are in that situation. I thought the name; Hope was such an appropriate name Stacey chose for her. Poor Keanu and his Escort; what an awful situation for his first Escorting job.

19/10/2017,"The storyline involving Max, everyone who lives on the square and Grafton Hill/ Weyland is ridiculous and I cannot understand why the writers were allowed to get away with such drivel for so long. I don't think any of the writers are actual Eastenders...if they were, they would know that when companies take over areas to overfill them with matchbox apartments for people from wealthier backgrounds, they simply offer vast sums to the local council for land, make the original residents homeless or shift them out to Essex with some loose change and get on with it. All this scheming does not happen in the real world. Also, why is nobody suspicious pf Max being at the hospital all the time even though he has a job?",15454160,EastEnders,2,34,6

19/10/2017,"It's becoming unwatchable. The Ginger Ninja is awful, I cannot stand looking at him any longer - I loathe him as an actor and as a person. Just cannot stand the sight of him. If this story line continues any longer, the ratings of Eastenders will plummet. I've looked at their web page and the reviews of this current story line are appalling. Get rid of Max and all of his cronies as I can see the show folding should it continue in this way. I have noted that Bobby might return and murder Max - bring it on and take out Fi and Luke and all of his family. This part of the story line is going nowhere fast. Who, in their right minds, would want to destroy the Vic and build a plastic pub in its place? The writers must have just come out of the asylum!",17300246,EastEnders,1,77,8

16/11/2017,Oh dear Ben is like a loose cannon; will he believe Wilmot Brown? do we believe him as well. I thought the meal bit to raise money for the Vic was a bit of a shambles; did not enjoy that bit very much. What a changed Character Stacey is I hope she is able to sustain this mood. I don't think Hope looks like a very premature baby; perhaps you could not find one to play the part. I really am losing patience with that selfish Becky; how she has treated Shakie. He does not deserve it he is such a handsome boy. Sonia is being a really weak character at the moment.

20/11/2017,"It has suddenly become much, much better than in previous months and years. If there is a new director then well done to him/her as the story lines are good, the direction is tight and the gay story lines seemed to have been lessened in favour of humour from Kim and others.

20/11/2017,"Really enjoyed it, as I always do.. I feel really sorry for Karen & her Loan Shark dilemma.. I had my reservations about her character when the family first joined Eastenders but the family have highlighted some important issues & I am not happy that they were depicted as 'scroungers' because she has children with disabilities & is obviously struggling financially - something that a lot of people can relate to in the UK at the current time.. I was also puzzled by Lee's friend telling stories of him going drinking with Lee - as I recall, Lee had Depression & drinking was a problem & the main reason he broke up with Witney, so not sure that that was well thought out by the writers..",13884919,EastEnders,2,51,10

Can somebody take him up on the roof of The Vic and show him the sights of The Square, perhaps as a flying visit to the Square aka ""given the push""! I cannot stand the sight of Jake Wood nor of his character - he needs despatching soon along with the motley crew",17300246,EastEnders,1,77,10

Do the writers know what tough East end men are and how they act. I think not ??? Max would have got a lot more stick than he is getting too. So not convincing all round.

25/12/2017,"Again, Eastenders at its best. Usual cliffhangers around the landlords of the Queen Vic, what are Phil and Aiden et al really up to and the Brannings. What do they have against the roof of the 'Vic? Whatever you do Tanya do not allow Oscar up on to the roof. This has really set up the soap for an intriguing New Year with a whole gamut of storylines to follow. Just a pity that Josh will, presumeably, not feature anymore now that he has a new job in Scotland. Who gave him references if he had fallen out with his father?",13900317,EastEnders,2,58,8
25/12/2017,DISAPOINTED ABOUT LAUREN AND ABI EXIT. THE JUMPLNG FROM THE ROOF HAS ALEADY FEATURED IN ANOTHER EPISODE OF EASTENDERS YEARS AGO.

25/12/2017,"Oh, bugger, the Ginger Ninja's got nine lives. First, he survives Ian Beale smacking him on his head with a heavy fry pan- and he survived that. Next, he survived a punch up with Ian then a good hiding with Phil plus a very near miss with a ""shooter"". He then feels he's had enough in this world and wants to meet his maker (whoever that might be) only to be followed by his two whinging daughters who insist their dearest father should come down, standing on the wrong side of the parapet for safety sake but the scriptwriters have no thoughts of safety and lure them the wrong side. What a shame, the Ginger Ninja didn't fall off the parapet with them. Pathetic writing - 'elf 'n safety were no consulted and the wrong person(s) are eliminated from the series. Not only has the Ginger Ninja had a bad hand into the killing of Steven, the disappearance of Jane and now the indirect death of his own daughters he deserves to be sent down for life and key thrown away. I hope I never see the likes of him ever again on this show. Goodbye Jake Woods",17300246,EastEnders,1,77,10

The good news was the birth of Abi's daughter. Delighted to see Fi give her father what he deserves. I have little time for Bernadette but,2776642,EastEnders,2,78,7

29/12/2017,"I still prefer this show to Coronation Street and Emmerdale. If they had done something similar to the Wilmot-Brown storyline, I would feel I was watching it done by comic characters in a serious story. I don�۪�۪�۪�۪t see the dark drama in those shows in the same way as it is done in Eastenders. Even Stacey, doing something stupid carrying on with Max, I still like her as a character. I like Hannah Spearitt�۪�۪�۪�۪s appearance. I hadn�۪�۪�۪�۪t read previously that she is appearing in the show, and I thought: hey, it looks like her. I hope to see more of her.",1133621,EastEnders,1,54,8

29/12/2017,I do hope the Vic landlord is leaving as he could not act to save his life. He walks like a penguin and cannot string words together in English. Surely the BBC budget can afford a real actor.,2622510,EastEnders,1,74,4

29/12/2017,Typical soap - has its ups and downs,17596879,EastEnders,1,62,6
29/12/2017,I loved the bit when Kusch and Denise came down the stairs starker's; into the sitting room where his Mum and brother were. There was shock; then laughter it was so funny; Kusch had told Denise his Mu and Brother were moving in. well done with that hilarity. The mysterious meeting of the gang; at the undertakers; that was a good idea! What are they up to; will it go to plan; I doubt it. The birth of Abi's baby was not very realistic surely if I have the date's right; was premature and would have been whisked off to an incubator; we only saw it's head; then Max was holding her. not very authentic. The party at the Vic was a very raucous affair; The Taylor Family very evident there.,10721021,EastEnders,2,81,10
29/12/2017,"The plots are all over the place and I keep feeling like I am missing episodes or not understanding what�۪�۪s happening. Feels like poor editing or writing, not at all what I�۪�۪d expect from a drama. A really jarring and unpleasant watch.",17534489,EastEnders,2,44,6

29/12/2017,"The end of this program was likened to to a comedy with all of the Gang totally stoned. Aidan must be gutted, so let's hope that they get their rewards without too much of a mishap. After I had watched this comedy act, I turned over to the Yesterday program and viewed Racing Legends: Jackie Stewart - fantastic program followed by the story of the greatest crash at Le Mans - these programs were far better than the countless repeats that are still being run, repeats of repeats of repeats - you know what I mean. I'm so glad I do not have to pay anymore to watch this rubbish. When is there going to be a change of these monotonous repeats?

Why isn't she at their bedsides? How is Abi's baby ok at only 27 weeks? Why is everybody partying in the Vic despite the fact two people fell off the roof a few days earlier?! Very poorly written.
